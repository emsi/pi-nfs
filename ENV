# Should we enable readonly root filesystem with overlayfs in ram?

# When readonly root is on there happenes to be one problem,
# when dhcpcd detects network interface going down/up it tries to execute
# a bunch of scripts (this happenes only when interface loosing link no
# when there is some routing problem down the path).However when network
# is down those scripts cannot be accessed over nfs thus dhcpcd blocks
# forever and is unable to bring the networkconfiguration back once the
# interface is up again.
# There are two ways to remedy the issue. One is to disable dhcpcd
# and stick to IP obtained during boot by kernel's dhcpc implementation.
# It seems OK but requires us to configure the stuff that dhcpcd is up to
# manually (like DNS resolver and so on). Might not be ideal but at least
# pi should unfreeze once network is back again.
# Thus disabling dhcpcd might be good idea when we use readonly root.
# Alternatively (or complementarly) we can use netflapdog service that
# reboots the pi immediately once it detects interface going down.
# Might seem harsh yet readonly root machine should be treated more like
# a container just doing some job (usually working as kiosk) so it would
# pose no serious threat to damage data.
# On the other hand mixing RO_ROOT="no" and ENABLE_NETFLAPDOG="yes"
# is usually a bad idea.
